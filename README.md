# Mini-Games
A few mini-games like Blackjack and Memory Puzzler/Trainer in Rust. 

## Project Description
  
  This project for CS410/510 Rust will be a few mini-games like Blackjack and Memory Puzzler/Trainer. 
  By making these games, I'll develop my skills in Rust and become more fluent in the language. 
  to become more familiar with the Rust Programming Language. I plan on making Blackjack with a simple AI that 
  follows the typical house rules of a casino. The Memory Puzzler/Trainer is a simple matching game that matches 
  the same characters. I plan on using a command-line interface for these games unless I find a few crates that
  could enhance the games. If time permits, I will add 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four. 

## Example GameplayImages
  
  These images were taken from google searches. I plan to imitate the look even if it is within the simpler
  command line interface.
